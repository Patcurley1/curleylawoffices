# individualproject - Law Office of Richard T. Curley, P.C. Unofficial Website
# Project Name and Description
Individal Project for OPIM 668 Internet Business Technologies.  Requirements are to plan, design, and develop a website for personal or professional purposes. Each website should contain at least three different pages, as well as any scripts, images, and icons needed for proper function and form. The site should maintain consistent style and navigation across pages. The site should be accessible over the Internet via public-facing URL.

The project is an upgrade for my Dad's law firm website.  This site (https://www.curleylawpc.com/) was built off of HMTL 1.0, so there is plenty of room to develop.  The structure of the site goes as follows:
    1. Index/Home/Landing Page - this introduces you to the firm and a sampling of their practice areas.  It also includes a Call To Action - suggesting you set up a meeting with Tim. I spent an insane amount of time trying to cobble together a .typed.js title/introduction (references: https://redstapler.co/typed-js-tutorial/ and https://github.com/Orlandster/wc-typed-js and https://codepen.io/merb/pen/yOwJjj and https://www.mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/) that never ended up working.  While I believe that I took all elements of this code out, some pieces may still be stranded in the code.  The carousel is partially cobbled together from a variety of sources, largely drawing from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku_97a6Bgkg and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67117035/bootstrap-5-carousel-not-sliding, but also a smattering of other stack overflow pages and bootstrap code components.  Stock photos were retreived from unsplash.com. Navigation panel was built leveraging w3 as a basis.
    2. About Us - Further giving details on the firm and their mission statement.  I used Google Street View for this picture and embedded Google Maps with the firm's office location built into the page for client ease of use.  I used w3 and bootstrap components for the blockquote testimonial. The image and text side by side was adapted from code found here: https://www.delftstack.com/howto/html/text-next-to-image-html/. 
    3. Staff - Briefly showing and describing the team behind the firm.  This leveraged w3 examples for flipcard HTML/CSS/JS code.  
    4. Contact Us - The purpose of this page is to begin discussions electronically with clients that prefer not to jump directly into a meeting. Disclaimer content was pulled from existing website disclaimer.  Embedded Google Form so that information could be stored in Google Sheets.  Listed other mechanisms to contact the firm including an email link, links to my Dad's LinkedIn, and a fictitious Twitter account embedded in the web page.   
    5. Scheduling - Calendly embed to schedule time with attorney and additional contact information.  
    

# Contributing
Right now and for the foreseeable future, the only contributor is me (Pat Curley).

# Acknowldegements 
While I worked on the code myself, there are a number of sources that I relied on heavily. 
1. The original base case of the website developed much of the content https://www.curleylawpc.com/  
2. W3 Schools
3. Twitter Bootstrap
4. Youtube tutorials
5. StackOverflow
6. Brian Johnson from class was also a critical sounding board for problems and helping with specific code issues.
7. I benefited greatly from the original student-site that we worked through in class. 
8. I also referenced last year's examples that were presented in the slack channel as best.  I don't believe that I developed anything from them, however. 
9. I tried to adapt code from .typed.js, and there are plenty of helpful sources on that (just not quite helpful enough for my talent level).
10. I also worked with Abhijit Gollanapalli, who may still yet respond to an email that I sent earlier which could improve the website. 
11. This project was simultaneously fun, creative, and infuriating.
