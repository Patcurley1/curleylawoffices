    <b> Disclaimer - PLEASE READ</b>
    Dispatch of an email inquiry and/or exchange of emails with a representative of the Law Offices of Richard T. Curley, P.C. does not establish an attorney-client relationship. <br>
    Only the execution of a fee agreement and/or other agreement regarding the assumption of representation by a lawyer with the firm completes the formation of the attorney-client relationship. <br>
    Further, in the event that time is of the essence to communicate with the lawyers of the Law Offices of Richard T. Curley, P.C., it is highly recommended that you speak directly with the lawyer to whom you are directing your inquiry. <br>
    Email, while available as a form for the initial inquiry and for interim communications with your lawyer, may not be an effective means of communicating with us under certain circumstances, and time sensitive contacts should be communicated directly with us, rather than through email.
